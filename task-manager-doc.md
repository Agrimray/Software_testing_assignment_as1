# Task Management Web App – Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the requirements for the **Task Management Web Application**, designed to help users organize, track, and complete their daily tasks efficiently. It specifies both functional and non-functional requirements to ensure that the application meets user expectations in terms of usability, performance, and security.

### 1.2 Scope

The Task Management Web App will allow users to:

* Create, update, delete, and manage tasks.
* Set task priorities, due dates, and tags.
* Monitor progress using a dashboard that categorizes tasks as pending, completed, or overdue.

The application is intended for individuals, professionals, and small teams seeking a lightweight, intuitive, and responsive solution for productivity and task organization.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

This document is intended for:

* **Developers** implementing the frontend, backend, and database.
* **Testers/QA team** validating application performance and functionality.
* **Project managers** overseeing the app’s development lifecycle.
* **End users** who will interact with the system once deployed.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 User Authentication

* Users must be able to register and log in securely.
* Passwords must be stored using strong encryption (e.g., bcrypt).
* Implement secure session handling with token-based authentication (JWT).
* Provide “Forgot Password” and “Reset Password” functionality.
* Support optional third-party login (Google, GitHub) via OAuth.

### 2.2 Task Management

* Users can:

  * Create new tasks with title, description, priority, due date, and tags.
  * Edit and update existing tasks.
  * Delete tasks permanently.
  * Mark tasks as completed or pending.
* Tasks should support:

  * Multiple tags (e.g., Work, Study, Personal).
  * Priority levels (Low, Medium, High).
  * Due dates with reminders or color-coded alerts for overdue tasks.
* Optional: Allow assigning tasks to other registered users (for team usage).

### 2.3 Dashboard

* Display categorized task lists:

  * **Pending Tasks**
  * **Completed Tasks**
  * **Overdue Tasks**
* Provide sorting and filtering by:

  * Status (pending, completed, overdue)
  * Priority
  * Due date
  * Tag
* Include a search bar for quick access to specific tasks.
* Display analytics (optional enhancement):

  * Number of tasks completed this week.
  * Pending tasks count.
  * Productivity trends over time.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance

* Average page load time should not exceed **2 seconds** on standard broadband.
* The backend API should respond within **500 milliseconds** under normal load.

### 3.2 Security

* All communication between frontend and backend must use **HTTPS**.
* Implement secure authentication (JWT) and CSRF protection.
* Input validation and sanitization must be enforced to prevent XSS and SQL/NoSQL injection attacks.
* User passwords and tokens must never be logged or exposed.

### 3.3 Usability

* The user interface must be **intuitive**, with clear navigation and consistent design.
* Color-coded indicators for priority and status.
* Provide responsive alerts and validation messages.

### 3.4 Reliability and Availability

* The system should have **99% uptime** under normal operating conditions.
* Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure stability.
* Data should persist even after unexpected shutdowns.

### 3.5 Scalability

* The system should support at least **10,000 concurrent users** without degradation.
* Backend APIs and database must be designed for horizontal scaling.

### 3.6 Compatibility

* Must be compatible with latest versions of **Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari**.
* Support both **desktop** and **mobile** views with responsive layout.
